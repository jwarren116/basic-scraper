# Web Scraper

*This scraper was built in the Code Fellows Python Dev Accelerator in February/March 2015*


The Step1 branch constructs a basic scraper that scrapes health inspection reports from the King County Dept. of Health. Results are returned as the restaurant name with a dictionary containing score details.

The Step2 branch adds to the basic scraper a GeoJSON mapping feature. The scraper outputs the results to a .json map that displays location for each of the restaurants in the scraped area.
