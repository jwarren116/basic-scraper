# Web Scraper

*This scraper was built in the Code Fellows Python Dev Accelerator in February/March 2015*


The Step1 branch constructs a basic scraper that scrapes health inspection reports from the King County Dept. of Health. Results are returned as the restaurant name with a dictionary containing score details.
